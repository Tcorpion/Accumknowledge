Here are some repeated experiments and recordings related to:
0. ***** Daily leetcode (in python/c++)

1. **** (Review) Metric Learning + Loss Functions + Self-Supervised Learning.
   These three items are combined together for they are always coupled with each other closely.

2. **** (Review) Segmentation + Fine-Grained Recognition
   2.1 Semantic Segmentation
   2.2 Instance Segmentation
   2.3 Panoptic Segmentation

3. **** (Review) Detection + Fine-Grained Recognition
   3.1 Anchor Based
       3.1.1 One Stage
       3.1.2 Two Stage
   3.2 Anchor Free
       3.2.1 One Stage
       3.2.2 Two Stage

4. **** (Review) Model Deployment on server

5. *** Face recognition + Land Mark + metric learning

6. *** Transformer

7. *** RL Introduction

8. *** OCR Application

9. *** NLP
   9.1 (Review) NLP introduction
   9.2 DL based
   9.3 OCR + NLP

10. *** SLAM + 3D 

11. *** Cpp, makefile, cmake, CMakeList.txt, design pattern(in c++/python/java)

12. *** Model lightweight
    11.1 Model deployment on embedding/mobile system
    11.2 Model quantization
