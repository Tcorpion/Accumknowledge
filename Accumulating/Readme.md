Here are some repeated experiments and recordings related to:
```
0. ***** Daily leetcode (in python/c++)

1. **** (Review) Metric Learning + Loss Functions + Self-Supervised Learning.
   These three items are combined together for they are always coupled with each other closely.

2. **** (Review) Segmentation + Fine-Grained Recognition
   2.1 Semantic Segmentation
   2.2 Instance Segmentation
       tricks: FPN + IOU Loss 
   2.3 Panoptic Segmentation

3. **** (Review) Detection + Fine-Grained Recognition
   3.1 Anchor Based
       3.1.1 One Stage
       3.1.2 Two Stage
   3.2 Anchor Free
       3.2.1 One Stage
       3.2.2 Two Stage

4. **** (Review) Model Deployment on server

5. *** Face recognition + Land Mark + metric learning

6. *** Transformer
    [reference 1](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/43493999, https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/44121378)

7. *** RL Introduction

8. *** OCR Application

9. *** NLP
   9.1 (Review) NLP introduction
   9.2 DL based
   9.3 OCR + NLP

10. *** SLAM + 3D 

11. *** Cpp, makefile, cmake, CMakeList.txt, design pattern(in c++/python/java)

12. *** Model lightweight
    11.1 Model deployment on embedding/mobile system
    11.2 Model quantization
    11.3 Model pruning 
    11.4 Model distillation

13. ** DL on Video

14. * DL on Audio

15. *** Daily Reading on Maths books

(The number of `*` represents priority.)
```

The above experiments will **take less than 50% time** compared to repeating on mmdetection/mmsegmentation, since **in 
mmdetection/mmsegmentation more methods and parameters** will be used.
