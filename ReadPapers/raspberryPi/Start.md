### Start from raspberry pi 3 b+

I got a `raspberry pi 3 b+` two years ago. Today I come to play it from scratch.

Device: raw board without MicroSD Card. So I follow [the tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/59027897) :

* buy a MicroSD Card with ubuntu18.04 mate OS at Taobao (35Yuan for sd card + 5Yuan for express)
* start the OS as normal ubuntu installation. 
* refers to [here](https://www.jb51.net/article/63103.htm) to install library in advance before installing numpy/opencv 
* start calling camera in `cv-tricks/usb_camera.py`
* TODO and deploy pytorch/tf/python and its like.
* TODO start a camera project with NanoDet, a 1.8M detection model widely reported on public wechart.
* TODO start yolo / ssd.
