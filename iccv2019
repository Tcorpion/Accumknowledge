# Few shot learning 
1. Few-ShotLearningwithGlobalClassRepresentations  
This paper provides a new trick that combines the base classes and novel classes in episode training, representing a class
with its centric point of all in-class featrues extracted from a cnn-network, iteratively updating the centric points of the 
subset of all classes by 
a) the episodic projection relationship between a mini-batch and global representations.
b) a query image's classification loss using nearest neighbour among all latest representations of classes.
