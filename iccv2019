1. Few-Shot Learning with Global Class Representations  
This paper provides a new trick that combines the base classes and novel classes in episode training, representing a class
with its centric point of all in-class featrues extracted from a cnn-network, iteratively updating the centric points of the 
subset of all classes by 
a) the episodic projection relationship between a mini-batch and global representations.
b) a query image's classification loss using nearest neighbour among all latest representations of classes.

2. S4L:Self-Supervised Semi-Supervised Learning
This paper targets to un-supervised learning, but it is also a fine-grain related paper that is similar to JD-restruct-construct(CVPR2019)
